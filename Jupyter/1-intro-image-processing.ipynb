    "Before applying segmentation or a machine learning model on the imaging data set there may be a number of preprocessing steps that can transform the image and adjust numerous parameters such as brightness, contrast, noise. We may also want to combine or split color channels or apply filters that enhance or suppress certain image features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how to load a microscopy image in Python using `python-bioformats`. We load images as `numpy.array` objects. We also show how the images represented as `numpy.array` can be preprocessed using various transformations avaialbe in `scikit-image` library before downstream analysis, such as segmentation, is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step before running this notebook would be to set up a conda environment with all the dependencies (see README for instructions). Once the environment is set up, activate it and start jupyter server in the environment.\n"
